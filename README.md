# TicTacToeMinimax
I recently found out about the Minimax algorithm being used in AI for various kinds of decision-making games. I wanted to try it out and therefore made a Tic-tac-toe game. It is produced entirely in Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern, where the Model and View parts are separate from each other and interact with each other strictly via Controller.
